The project I built as a challenge for Trivago Magazine.

I gave myself the opportunity to change some of the design and copied some of the functionalities on the live site.

I chose Nuxt.js for it's great ability for SSR (Server Side Rendering) which makes it so easy to reach by search engine crawlers.

The project is simply divided into simple parts:
-layouts
	default.vue 	->	is the main template for the website
-components			->  Contains simple reusable components
-pages
	-posts
		_slug.vue	->  The main view for each article page
